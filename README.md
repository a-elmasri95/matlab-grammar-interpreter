# Matlab-Grammar-Interpreter

For the programming languages undergrad course project, I used ANTLR and JASMIN to create an interpreter for Matlab.
Run the batch file 'run.bat' to get the output for the input matlab code as in the 'project_description' file. 'T.g' file was the 
main grammar file that handled the syntax and semantics logic for matlab. 
JBE was also used to analyze the generated JVM code. 
A sample output for the provided input1.txt is shown as a screenshot when run on windows OS.
